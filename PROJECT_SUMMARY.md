## ✅ What's Working

1. ✅ **Video Upload Interface** - Easy drag-and-drop
2. ✅ **Pose Detection** - MediaPipe tracking 33 body points
3. ✅ **Release Angle Analysis** - Calculates elbow angle (90-120° optimal)
4. ✅ **Visual Feedback** - Skeleton overlay on video
5. ✅ **Detailed Reports** - Specific recommendations for improvement
6. ✅ **Web Interface** - Clean, professional Gradio UI
7. ✅ **Portfolio-Ready** - Complete documentation and tests

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Immediate Steps:

1. **Extract the files** from the project folder
2. **Open terminal** in the project directory
3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:7860
5. **Upload a basketball shooting video** and click analyze!

## 📊 What It Analyzes

### Current Feature: Release Angle
- Tracks the shooter's elbow angle at the release point
- Compares against optimal range (90-120°)
- Provides specific feedback and recommendations

### How It Works:
1. MediaPipe detects 33 body landmarks in each frame
2. Tracks wrist height to identify release point
3. Calculates angle between shoulder-elbow-wrist
4. Generates feedback based on shooting biomechanics

## 💼 Portfolio Value

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project:

1. **Why This Project?**
   "I wanted to combine my interest in basketball with my data science skills. I saw an opportunity to use computer vision to help players improve their shooting form."

2. **Technical Challenge:**
   "The main challenge was accurately identifying the release point from video. I solved this by tracking wrist height across frames and using the peak position to determine when to analyze the shooting angle."

3. **Design Decisions:**
   "I chose MediaPipe over training a custom model because it's production-ready and accurate. This let me focus on the analysis logic rather than model training."

4. **What I Learned:**
   "Working with real-time video processing taught me about optimization and the importance of user experience. I also learned to balance accuracy with processing speed."

5. **Future Improvements:**
   "I'd add multiple angle analysis, shot tracking over time, and real-time camera input. Could also extend to other sports like football or volleyball."

## 📈 Next Steps for Enhancement

### Quick Wins (1-2 weeks each):
1. **Left-handed toggle** - Simple modification to support lefties
2. **Follow-through analysis** - Analyze wrist snap angle
3. **Shot database** - Track improvement over time
4. **Export reports** - PDF generation of analysis

### Major Features (1+ month each):
1. **Mobile app** - React Native version
2. **Real-time camera** - Live feedback during shooting
3. **Multi-angle analysis** - Combine front + side views
4. **ML model training** - Custom model for better accuracy
